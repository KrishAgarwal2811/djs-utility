> **Note**
> This Account and repo is for the purpose of demonstrating potential **Repo Jacking** Attack.
This is not the original repo you are looking for!
The original author changed their username, but didn't modify entries in their package.json and other potential places.
And a malicious actor could have used the loophole in their favour to distribute malicious code for their own gains.
Always try to prevent these types of attacks by not changing/deleting your usernames unnecessarily and if changed, modify it on accordingly on all of the potential places.
